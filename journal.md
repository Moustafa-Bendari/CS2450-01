Date: 1.9.25 - Subject: What I learned today. We talked about the importance of keeping an engineering journal.I will try to write in it after every class, because I am a really forgetful person. I can also see how this can be very useful, because I feel like everyone gets crazy engineering ideas but we forget them all the time, atleast thats the case for me, so writing them in journal seems like a solid idea.

Date: 1.16.25 - Subject: What is git. Git is a version control system that tracks changes in code, helps collaboration, and manages project history. Alway remember the order:
1) git add . 
2) git commit -m "commit message"
3) git push 
    

Date: 1.23.25 - Subject: What is Flask. Simply: it is a light weight python framework, used for building APIs and web apps. Reminder: A framework is like a set of ready-made tools and rules that help you build something faster and easierâ€” kind of like a Lego set for coding. Instead of starting from scratch, you get a set of prebuilt parts that you can use and customize as needed.

Date: 1.30.25 - Subject: We learned what are user stories. User stories said simply are a description of the OUTCOME of the small unit of work. Class Example: AS A world leader, I WANT a space to posture againts others, SO THAT i can achieve geo political dominance. Details: Profiles for leaders, Direct messages, Timeline/Story.

Date: 2.4.25 - Subject: What are Observer Pattern. The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that defines a one-to-many relationship between objects. It allows an object (known as the subject) to notify a list of dependents (observers) about changes in its state. This pattern is particularly useful in situations where a change in one object requires updating others without tightly coupling the objects. 

Date: 2.6.25 - Subject: What are Flow Diagrams. A flow diagram (also called a flowchart) is a visual representation of a process, system, or algorithm using symbols and arrows to illustrate the flow of steps, decisions, and actions. The shapes and symbols include: circle = steps, round box = simple process, Diamond = decisions (if statement, yes or no), box with sideboxes = complex process ( abstract it.)

Date: 2.11.25 - Subject: We learned the fundamentals of an impactful Presentation. The 3 main things that make a BIG difference in your Presentation, 1- Who's the Audience? 2-What are the Goals? 3- Follow Design Principles. Also remember the COLOR EMOTION GUIDE CHART. I am thinking of talking to my team to make the team's logo purple related to creativity, not a bad idea.

Date: 2.20.25 - Subject: Using Git Branches:

    1) git branch "<branch>"  # Create a new branch.  
    2) git checkout "<branch>"  # Switch to that branch.  

    or combined into  
    git checkout -b "<branch>" # to create and switch into that branch.  
    
    Steps after you are in the branch:  
    1) Do your thing (Edit files)
    2) git add .
    3) git commit -m "words"
    4) git push "<branch>"

Date: 2.25.25 - Subject: The Software Development Process (How Software Engineers Work in Real Life, Using a Kanban Board - which acts as a structured to-do list.)
1. An issue (task) is created.
2. The issue is added to the Kanban board within the project.
3. Either a team member assigns the issue to themselves, or the Scrum Master assigns it.
4. The assignee moves the issue from "To Do" to "In Progress."
5. The assignee creates a new branch to work on the code.
6. Once the code is completed, the assignee moves the issue to "Done" on the Kanban board.
7. The assignee creates a Pull Request (PR) for the new code.
8. Another team member reviews the code.
9. The Scrum Master (or an authorized reviewer) merges the pull request.
10. The issue is officially marked as "Done."

Date: 3.4.25 - Subject: Ethics. 
Things to remember:  
1. Where is your line? (e.g., working for companies whose business models you may disagree with, working for the military, ethical hacking, etc.)
2. Remember to Consider:
Intent vs. Consequence, 
Exploitation vs. Entertainment, 
Personal vs. Professional Ethics

Date: 3.6.25 - Subject: User Experience
-Barriers: Security vs Usability, Ease/Cost of development vs Usability, Application Requirements/ Shortcomings vs Usability, Complexity of the Task vs Usability.  
-Steps: 1.Ideation(What does the user want to do? Why?)  2.Story Board(What's the flow?) 3.Wireframes(Low-fidelity sketches of layout) 4.Prototype(This is a cycle: Build something, User Testing, feedback, re-do) 5.Development(More user Testing)

Date: 3.18.25 - Subject: Software Quality. 
Key Takeways:
1. you must have a quality mindset - quality must be built in from the ground up
2. Developers are the primary responsible party to ensure they build QUALITY software.
3. You are never 100%.

Date: 3.25.25 - Subject: Refactoring - Benefits:
1. Maintainability: Readability, Extensibility, Easier to test.
2. Re-usability: Interfaces, Generic Code, Clear functionality.
3. Preformance: Efficient Code.
4. Cost Reduction: Maintenance, Testing, Fewer.
