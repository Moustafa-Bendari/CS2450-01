Date: 1.19.25 - Subject: What I learned today. We talked about the importance of keeping an engineering journal.I will try to write in it after every class, because I am a really forgetful person. I can also see how this can be very useful, because I feel like everyone gets crazy engineering ideas but we forget them all the time, atleast thats the case for me, so writing them in journal seems like a solid idea.
